[PAWN_pronoun] found a very physical and exhausting opportunity [PAWN_pronoun] could not afford to refuse in an overcrowded city. [PAWN_pronoun] found a cheap appartment, but was unaware of the consequences that come with cheap prices. [PAWN_possessive] neighbor enjoyed having fun and did not care who was listening. Every night he had a new partner. Every night [PAWN_nameDef] had to go through grunts, strident scratches, moanings without even having the strength nor willpower to make them stop. [PAWN_pronoun] ended up becoming very attached to decent living conditions and disgusted with his own race animality.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_nameDef] was the least qualified out of all the mental patients to enter the dreamscape. A virtual reality embedded within a fungus network that kept the hive social links as a backup but got deeply altered by the infection. [PAWN_nameDef] achieved what none of his pairs could and restored the hive social links. [PAWN_pronoun] got banned from [PAWN_possessive] community for his efforts because everybody felt [PAWN_pronoun] had an awkward ascendancy over them.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>As [PAWN_nameDef] was spending the evening at the bar, [PAWN_pronoun] got caught in a brawl. A swinging claw stabbed [PAWN_objective] in the chest. [PAWN_pronoun] was dead for over an hour and a half. During that time, [PAWN_pronoun] rose up out of [PAWN_possessive] body and went into the light. Curious about the universe, [PAWN_pronoun] was taken far into the remote depths of existence, and even beyond, into the energetic void of nothingness behind the Big Bang. Then the Light turned into the most beautiful thing that [PAWN_pronoun] had ever seen: a mandala of mantiss souls on this planet. It changed [PAWN_possessive] opinion of mantiss beings in an instant. [PAWN_pronoun] said/thought/felt, "Oh, God, I didn't realize." [PAWN_pronoun] was astonished to find that there was no evil in any soul. People may do terrible things out of ignorance and lack, but no soul is evil. "What all people seek – what sustains them – is love," the Light told [PAWN_objective]. "What distorts people is a lack of love." [PAWN_nameDef] survived and got touched by grace as a return gift for [PAWN_possessive] wounds.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was a well-connected Mantiis ex-spy dude who had dug [PAWN_possessive] roots deep into the mercenary business. [PAWN_pronoun] took a mission to replace a peripheral hive overlord with a sibling of [PAWN_possessive], who lived in exile. [PAWN_nameDef] was told that things were extremely bad under the old overlord, and the regime desperately needed to be changed. This proved to be untrue. Instead, [PAWN_nameDef] was arrested, during the very first part of [PAWN_possessive] mission. [PAWN_pronoun] had been trying to replace a surprisingly healthy regime that very much objected to [PAWN_possessive] antics. [PAWN_pronoun] and several co-conspirators found themselves in various prisons, and the whole coup turned out to be a wistful attempt to gain access to significant oil riches.</baseDesc>
