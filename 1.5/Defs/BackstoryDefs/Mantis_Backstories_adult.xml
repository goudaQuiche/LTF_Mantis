		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] used to be part of a pirate ship crew. [PAWN_nameDef] and [PAWN_possessive] crewmates often found themselves awakened by strange sounds. A few disparitions occured and the captain was always evasive about what happened. A paranoia atmosphere settled down. After too many months of an overcautious daily life, threatened by a nameless danger, [PAWN_nameDef] managed to escape the ship and [PAWN_possessive] fears.</description>

[PAWN_pronoun] had no choice but to try to talk to others and try to make favourable impression. What could happen if others figured out [PAWN_pronoun] was an impostor, a fake?</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] had to correct [PAWN_possessive] past financial mistakes. [PAWN_pronoun] found a very physical and exhausting opportunity [PAWN_pronoun] could not afford to refuse in an overcrowded city. [PAWN_pronoun] found a cheap appartment, but was unaware of the consequences that come with cheap prices. [PAWN_possessive] neighbor enjoyed having fun and did not care who was listening. Every night he had a new partner. Every night [PAWN_nameDef] had to go through grunts, strident scratches, moanings without even having the strength nor willpower to make them stop. [PAWN_pronoun] ended up becoming very attached to decent living conditions and disgusted with his own race animality.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was called a defected experiment. [PAWN_pronoun] used to be hosted by a high technology security startup but not anymore. They figured out it would be handier to erase [PAWN_possessive] memories about the company critical details instead of repairing the mess they did with [PAWN_possessive] body. [PAWN_nameDef] got thrown into the outside world with a few after-effects.</description>

		<description>A rogue scientist infected [PAWN_nameDef]'s hive mind. The only people with the capability of stopping him were those whose mental states were already damaged before the attack. [PAWN_nameDef] was the least qualified out of all the mental patients to enter the dreamscape. A virtual reality embedded within a fungus network that kept the hive social links as a backup but got deeply altered by the infection. [PAWN_nameDef] achieved what none of his pairs could and restored the hive social links. [PAWN_pronoun] got banned from [PAWN_possessive] community for his efforts because everybody felt [PAWN_pronoun] had an awkward ascendancy over them.</description>

		<description>Each year, the Eusociality comet passes by the small hive of [PAWN_nameDef]. It's a known tale that the comet itself holds unlimited powers, cursed by an ancestral mantis hive ruler. This time, when the comet could be seen for 13 days, [PAWN_nameDef] felt like [PAWN_pronoun] got engulfed by its light and message for [PAWN_objective]. [PAWN_pronoun] had to meet this colony and help its foundation, ascent and fall.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was responsible for disposing of foreigners and casualities corpses outside of the hive. This was a critical job, given that dead bodies attract predators and hasten the disease spread. From time to time, [PAWN_pronoun] also took time to rear a commemorative stone for the most brave veterans.</description>

		<description>As [PAWN_nameDef] was spending the evening at the bar, [PAWN_pronoun] got caught in a brawl. A swinging claw stabbed [PAWN_objective] in the chest. [PAWN_pronoun] was dead for over an hour and a half. During that time, [PAWN_pronoun] rose up out of [PAWN_possessive] body and went into the light. Curious about the universe, [PAWN_pronoun] was taken far into the remote depths of existence, and even beyond, into the energetic void of nothingness behind the Big Bang. Then the Light turned into the most beautiful thing that [PAWN_pronoun] had ever seen: a mandala of mantiss souls on this planet. It changed [PAWN_possessive] opinion of mantiss beings in an instant. [PAWN_pronoun] said/thought/felt, "Oh, God, I didn't realize." [PAWN_pronoun] was astonished to find that there was no evil in any soul. People may do terrible things out of ignorance and lack, but no soul is evil. "What all people seek – what sustains them – is love," the Light told [PAWN_objective]. "What distorts people is a lack of love." [PAWN_nameDef] survived and got touched by grace as a return gift for [PAWN_possessive] wounds.</description>

		<description>As [PAWN_nameDef] was living in [PAWN_possessive] homeland hive and [PAWN_pronoun] started working in [PAWN_possessive] family business. At the age of 18 years, [PAWN_pronoun] left for a peripheral solar system to become a mercenary accountant, like [PAWN_possessive] family was encouraging [PAWN_objective] to follow the mantiss ways. However, on arriving on the destination [PAWN_pronoun] realised that [PAWN_possessive] true calling in life was to become a Chef. So, to explore this field [PAWN_pronoun] enrolled to take classes at transcultural school of culinary arts. At the time of graduation [PAWN_pronoun] had two degrees, that is, [PAWN_pronoun] was trained as a Chef as well as an Accountant. [PAWN_pronoun] then chose [PAWN_possessive] profession to be a Chef and went on to work at many restaurants. [PAWN_pronoun] has authored cookbooks like - Menu by [PAWN_nameDef] and You should try this. [PAWN_pronoun] has also initiated a new project called "[PAWN_nameDef] Kitchen Lab" which is a culinary laboratory.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a well-connected Mantiis ex-spy dude who had dug [PAWN_possessive] roots deep into the mercenary business. [PAWN_pronoun] took a mission to replace a peripheral hive overlord with a sibling of [PAWN_possessive], who lived in exile. [PAWN_nameDef] was told that things were extremely bad under the old overlord, and the regime desperately needed to be changed. This proved to be untrue. Instead, [PAWN_nameDef] was arrested, during the very first part of [PAWN_possessive] mission. [PAWN_pronoun] had been trying to replace a surprisingly healthy regime that very much objected to [PAWN_possessive] antics. [PAWN_pronoun] and several co-conspirators found themselves in various prisons, and the whole coup turned out to be a wistful attempt to gain access to significant oil riches.</description>

		<description>When terrible things happen, many people are lastingly affected; in some, the effects are so persistent and severe that they are debilitating and constitute a disorder. [PAWN_nameDef] took care of many of [PAWN_possessive] siblings affected by their war memories. [PAWN_nameDef] has heard terrible stories, but by doing so [PAWN_pronoun] has lessened the burden of [PAWN_possessive] people.</description>
